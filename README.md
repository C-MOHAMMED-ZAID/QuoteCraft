# 📜 QuoteCraft — Random Quote Generator + Favorites + Search

**QuoteCraft** is a stylish, interactive quote application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It fetches motivational quotes from a public API, allows keyword-based search, and lets users save their favorite quotes—all with smooth UI and responsive behavior.

This project is part of my personal learning journey. It’s my **second self-built project**, created completely from scratch without following tutorials or copying others' code. After completing **FocusZone**, I wanted to challenge myself with API integration, error handling, DOM logic, and more advanced state management — and QuoteCraft was born.

## 🎯 Purpose

> **This project was built for learning by doing.**  
> After completing a simple to-do app (FocusZone), I wanted to step up and build a real-time web app with external data, live search, dynamic DOM manipulation, and persistent favorites.  
> No frameworks, no libraries — just raw skills, refined by building.

## ✅ What I Practiced

- Working with **fetch API** and **API key-based services**
- Creating **modular functions** for actions like `getRandomQuote()`, `addToFavorites()`, and `searchQuote()`
- Managing app state with variables like `currentQuote`
- Handling errors and edge cases gracefully
- Implementing **real-time filtering**
- Writing readable, maintainable JS code
- Designing a clean, centered, and interactive UI
